    "\n",
    "ENTSO gives us totals generated in MWh; we need to translate that to relative shares of the separat markets, while keeping the totals correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "The low voltage market is made up of PV and imports from medium voltage; similarly, the medium voltage is waste incineration and imports from high voltage. There are also losees in transmission and distribution, but we ignore these in this calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest to gets the numbers right is to start from low voltage (LV). Let's assume it is 100 MWh total. Then the total generation allocated to the aggregated LV generations sources is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{LV}{TOTAL}$\n",
    "\n",
    "And the import from MV is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{1 - LV}{TOTAL}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Medium voltage is already a bit trickier. We need to keep the absolute and relative numbers in our heads simultaneously. We want the fraction of the generation that MV sources can contribute as a fraction of the total MV market, which is MV plus HV, or TOTAL - LV. The scaling factor then applied to MV sources is then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{MV}{TOTAL - LV}$\n",
    "\n",
    "And the import from HV is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{1 - MV}{TOTAL - LV}$\n",
    "\n",
    "For HV, we can just normalize all HV sources to sum to one; there is no import from a higher voltage level.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we also need to include trade! So these equations are OK for comparing generation, we would need to substitute $IMPORTS + TOTAL$ for $TOTAL$ in each equation in actual use."
